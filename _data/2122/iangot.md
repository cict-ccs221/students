# My name is Ike J. Angot

I am 20 years old undergrad CS student currently studying at WVSU. My hobbies is watching K-Dramas or Anime. My favorite genre of movie is Action, and my favorite food is Adobong Baboy. I love deriving things except math, down to their history, how they are made and what they are made of and why where they made.

I have basic knowledge in C and C++.

Currently I'm working on a scientific calculator using console to improve my skills and a text based game in the CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) genre to improve my literary and decision making skills.

I like IU, a Korean singer/actress/songwriter. You can call me Ike, Mike or Kei.

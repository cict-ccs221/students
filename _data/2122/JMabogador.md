about_me
> - Hi! I am John Marc Mariano Abogador. They call me John or sometimes Marc as my nickname. I am 20 years old, and currently a computer science student at WVSU. Coming into my hobbies, i love to read mangas, watch anime, watch WWE during my free time. A genre of movies I like are action, comedy, horror and romance. Moreover, I love listening to music. I basically listen to music every time. Everything that is in a color of black and white, sweet foods, sea foods, kpop, and dramas are my likes. Drama because it gives me the sense of values or the moral lesson, it also has an inspiring different kind of situations.
